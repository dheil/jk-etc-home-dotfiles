# Screen

[Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) is a full-screen window manager.

This is the configuration file I used for many years. Now it's nearly deprecated,
 because I switched over to [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/).

I left it here for reference and situations where Tmux is not installed on a
host system, but screen may be.
